## What is VMware Workstation Pro?

**VMware Workstation Pro** is a industry-leading desktop hypervisor that allows users to run multiple operating systems as **virtual machines (VMs)** on a single physical PC. It provides a seamless and isolated environment for running different OSes like Windows, Linux, and more simultaneously without rebooting.

With VMware Workstation Pro, developers, IT professionals, and enthusiasts can:
- Create and manage complex development and testing environments.
- Run applications in isolated sandboxes for enhanced security.
- Snapshots and cloning for efficient workflow and backup.
- Integrate with cloud and container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

It supports a wide range of guest operating systems and is extensively used for software development, QA, demos, and training. Its robust feature set and reliability make it the go-to solution for professional virtualization needs on Windows and Linux hosts.
